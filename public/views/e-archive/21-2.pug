                    p We are happy to welcome Lilia, Raky, Sarah and Zina to the team of Artists Without Borders, four women passionate about digital and overflowing with creativity. For a period of four months, these web developers will support Helga  in the realization of digital projects.
                    p All four being great challengers, they wanted to add a string to their bow by training in development (in record time)!
                    p They know how to create your websites and mobile applications.
                    p So don't hesitate to approach the association, they will be happy to code and bring to life the web projects you have imagined!
