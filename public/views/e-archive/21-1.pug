                   p We all hope for a rebirth of cultural and social life - this tree erected over night in my path made me laugh, because it perfectly represents the cuts in life and the separation of friends and family.

            h3 Upcoming projects - Internships
            p For a large literary project, we call upon interns or volunteers, who wish to work as a developer on React or on a database, but also one or two interns interested in literature or culture. Start of the project in February, internships of at least six weeks for development and at least four weeks for the cultural aspect available throughout 2021.
